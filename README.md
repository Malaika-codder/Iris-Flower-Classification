# Iris-Flower-Classification
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

This repository contains a machine learning project dedicated to the classification of Iris flowers into their respective species. This is a foundational supervised learning problem that serves as an excellent introduction to classification algorithms in data science.


üéØ Project Objective
The primary goal is to build, train, and evaluate a robust machine learning model that can accurately classify an Iris flower into one of three species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, or Iris Virginica, based on four specific measurable features.

üìÇ Dataset Overview (The Iris Dataset)
This project utilizes the famous Iris Dataset, originally compiled by Ronald Fisher in 1936.

Total Samples: 150 (50 samples for each of the three species).

Target Classes (Species):

Iris Setosa

Iris Versicolor

Iris Virginica

Features (Attributes):

Sepal Length (in cm)

Sepal Width (in cm)

Petal Length (in cm)

Petal Width (in cm)

üíª Key Components & Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

Data Loading and Initial Inspection: Load the dataset and perform initial checks for structure, data types, and missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of each feature.

Use pair plots and scatter plots to analyze the relationships between the four features and how they separate the three species.

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for model training (e.g., splitting the data into training and testing sets).

Model Selection & Training: Implement and train a classification algorithm. Common choices include:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Decision Tree/Random Forest

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance on the test set using metrics like:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the species of a new, unseen Iris flower sample.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development and documentation)

Pandas and NumPy (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization/EDA)
